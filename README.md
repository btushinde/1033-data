##1033 data
WRAL News used the following data to report on agencies that received equipment under the federal 1033 excess military property program.

Data on equipment distribution under the program was obtained [from the federal Defense Logistics Agency](http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/EFOIA-Privacy/Pages/ereadingroom.aspx#1033). Rows include both tactical equipment such as weaponry and vehicles, which remains in the data permanently, as well as "general" equipment, which fall off the federal investory after 12 months with the receiving law enforcement agency.

Number of full-time sworn officers was obtained for each agency via [crime statistics from the N.C. Department of Justice](http://crimereporting.ncdoj.gov/Reports.aspx). After [scraping the data](https://github.com/mtdukes/custom-scrapers) from the site, sworn officer totals for 2013 were matched with database software with the federal 1033 equipment data to produce the files below.
